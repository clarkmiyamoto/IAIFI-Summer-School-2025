\section{Zhimei Liu: }
Given phenomelogicla parameters (i.e. $c = \{$coupling, manifold, etc.$\}$) can you infer the flux vector? Traditional methods include MCMC methods, so perhaps we can use a conditional DDPM model? She uses an ELBO loss, and computes sufficient statistics as an additional regularizer.

An interesting point she says is she does the domain adaptation technique for upscaling. I.e. the source domain are $x \in [-30, 30]^8$, and the target domain is $x \in [-50, 50]^8$.
